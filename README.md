# Android Hello World Test

[![Android CI](https://github.com/prasys/Android-Hello-World-Test/actions/workflows/android2.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/prasys/Android-Hello-World-Test/actions/workflows/android2.yml)

This is a test program for COSC345 (Software Engineering) on how to use Android Studio and also GitHub's CI to deploy and test

There is a CI which executes unit test and ensures that everything is working

Feel free to fork this out and experiment with my CI. The YML file compiles APK, runs android test (test UI elements) and unit tests (to test logic)
